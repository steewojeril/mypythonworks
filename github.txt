right click inside the target folder >>> Git bash here

# git init             (to initialize git repository in present working directory)
# git status           (to list all untracked files)
# git add -A           (to move all untracked files to staging area)
# git commit -m "msg"  (to move stagged files to local repository)

now create a new repository in github,
copy the path(link) the created repository(make sure http is selected)
now we need to add that remote to the local repository 

# git remote add "name" path  
# git remote -v  (to list the remote)
# git push "name" master    (to push the file to remote repository(name-reference name refering remote repo))

if we clone the file , reffer name will be origin(default name refering remote repo)
so git push origin 


clone >>> to get exact copy from the remote
# git clone path

pull  >>> to get only the changes from the remote
