# for loop doesnt execute up to upper limit
for i in range(1,10): #1 to 9
    print("hello")
# default incriment is 1
# in for loop, no need to specify incriment if we require 1 as incriment

# if we need a decriment, eg: we need 1 as decriment give value -1

# if there is 3 values in range :
    # first value >>> lower limit
    # second value >>> upper limit
    # third value >>> incriment/decriment


# to print only multiples of 6 from 4 to 25
for i in range(4,25,6): #4,10,16,22
    print(i)
