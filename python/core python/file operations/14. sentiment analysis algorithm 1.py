# sentiment analysis algorithm - find wehther the comment is positive or negative


# manually store comments in a file

# step 1- tokenization (split)  token means each word  <<< eg: good company  ==> good , company
# step 2- dictionary creation (create positive dic(positive words)  &   negative dic(neg words))
# compare each token with positive dic and neg dic
