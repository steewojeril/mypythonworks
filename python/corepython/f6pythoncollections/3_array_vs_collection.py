# In a variable only one value can be assigned
# for assigning multiple values in a variable

                        #array= collection of homogenous data

# int marks=new marks

# mark[0]
# mark[1]
# mark[2]
# mark[3]
# mark[4]

# drawback:-

# homogenous data
# size is fixed


                        #collection >>> collection of hetrogenous data


# properties of collection

# 1. how to define
# 2. hetrogenous data supported or not
# 3. duplicated values is allowed or not
# 4. insertion order is preserved or not
    # [1,2,3,4,5,6] ===>  [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    # if output order is same as that of input >>> preserved
    # else not preserved

# 5. mutable or imutable (updation of data)

    #  different types of collections

    # list
    # tuples
    # set
    # dictionary
