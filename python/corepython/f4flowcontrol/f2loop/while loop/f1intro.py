# while loop
    # Purpose: Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.
    # Use case: when the number of iterations is not known and depends on conditionn
# steps
# 1.intialization
# 2.condition
# 3.incriment / decriment


# to print "hello" 10 times

# using while loop

i=1                     #intialization
while(i<=10):           #condition
    print("hello")      #statement
    i+=1                #incriment / decriment

# i=1
# then checking i<=10 true so print "hello"
# then follow the next step (i+=1) now value of i is 2
# again go to block and so on finally
