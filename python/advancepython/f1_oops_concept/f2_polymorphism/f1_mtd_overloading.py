Method overloading
In languages like Java or C++, method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name 
but with different parameters (in terms of number or types). 
class Example {
    void print(int x) {
        System.out.println(x);  
    }
    
    void print(String x) {
        System.out.println(x);
    }

    void print(int x, String y) {
        System.out.println("Print method with int and String: " + x + " " + y);
    }
}
if we passing int value, it 1st mtd works. if string, 2nd works 

Python does not allow multiple methods with the same name within a class, 
even if the methods have different parameters. 
In Python, if you define a method with the same name more than once, the last definition will overwrite the previous ones.
