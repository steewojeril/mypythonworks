'''
Compilation is the process where the entire source code of a program is converted into machine code (binary code) before execution by a program called a **compiler**.

Interpretation is the process where the **source code** of a program is executed line by line, during runtime, by a program called an **interpreter**.

Python is mostly interpreted, but it first compiles the code to **bytecode** (which is not machine code but an intermediate form) before interpreting and executing it.
